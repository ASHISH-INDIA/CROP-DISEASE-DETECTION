# CROP-DISEASE-DETECTION
The Crop Disease Detection System leverages Deep Learning techniques to identify and classify plant diseases based on leaf images. By integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential data processing.
